## 3. Evaluation — Did You Deliver Your Statement of Intent?

This is the most important written part of your documentation. Evaluate the
website you **delivered** against the **Statement of Intent** you wrote during
planning. Be honest and use evidence — point to a page, a feature or a test.

### 3.1 Your Statement of Intent

My website - Studylog is an online website designed to support students from stage 3 to stage 6 (year 5 to year 12) in a range of core and elective subjects. This site will act as a source of summarised notes for students, featuring textbooks and online resources, a community comment area where users are able to explain and discuss on specialised topics with each other. It will also include a sign-up form system to receive notifications for updated syllabus, along with options to select which subject the user intends to study. This statement of intent is a key principle in planning as it structures the website to be outstanding in quality, and satisfies the user as intended. 

Currently, passionate students across the globe are required to search for materials online to improve their learning for tests, assignments, and their general academic level. However, it is extremely time consuming for users to seek accessible information and documents that are relevant to their studies. This can interfere with student's available time for personal purposes. By analysing the problem that affects our possible users, plans are then first being developed, and a more refined solution and code for this situation can be created. 

The main audience focussed by this website are students from stage 3 to stage 6 (year 5 -12) who are zealous in their learning career. The users that are targeted would be occupied by their learning and don't have enough time to view unnecessary documentation. This implies that the website must be simple and easy to use, along with a UI that could lead the users efficiently. Our secondary audience would be teachers, parents and guardians, who are tring to find suitable resources for their students / child. Identifying our primary and secondary audience allows the fundamental components of our design to be user friendly and targeted to ones who will actually use our website.

By creating a website that directly supports learning quality, students could sign up and access our free to use information for their studies, discuss on unsure topics, and stay updated to new resources. This will lead to more study time as they wouldn't be required to seek available information online, and instead be able to access related information almost instantly from the website. This improves student's learning as they could revise more practice resources. It can also resolve the problem that material hunting affects user’s personal time, as everything a student needs is contained in just one website. Through identifying the issue and its outcome, it will guarantee that the website will be usable and effective upon its release. 

Studylog is a study tool that could modify how students and teachers find resources, making users easier to enter in their learning or support other's knowledge. With updated syllabus resources, user comments and a sign up system to the website, it is expected to see an improvement in the member's quality of learning. This outcome is only seen through the planning process of identifying the issue and its solution, recognising the audience that we are trying to attract and determining the elements of the website. This will create a high quality base for a website that is designed for the users who will actually want to access it.

### 3.3 Evaluation Against Your Intent (2–3 paragraphs)

> Take each aim in your Statement of Intent and evaluate **how well the
> delivered site meets it**. Where did you meet your intent? Where did you fall
> short, and why? Support every judgement with evidence from your site.

<!-- Write 2–3 paragraphs. -->
The primary aim of Studylog was to create a relevant and accessible learning platform that reduces the time that keen students spend searching for study materials. The current product delivered meets this aim decently through the use of /core and /elective page, which automatically loads the year specific content using session data. This ensures students to gain instant access to the correct materials without filtering manually. The /userprivate dashboard also reinforces the aim by establishing a clear entry point for users to navigate themselves efficiently to the material. However, the current website could be improved by adding more resources in to the website as it currently has only one material per subject per grade, which limits the diversity of information in the notes and papers. Additionally, the planned “community comment area” was not implemented, reducing opportunities for collaborative learning and peer discussion.

The second aim that is being discussed is to design Studylog specifically for our audience. As mentioned in the Statement of Intent, our intended audience are Stage 3-6 students as primary, and teachers, parents, guardians as secondary. This intent is reflected throughout the site's structure through designing the website around the need of the personas created. By understanding what our audience needed, the navbar, homepage, dashboard, and authenticating pages has all avoided complexity, and became efficient to navigate. The routes /signup and /userform also only collected essential information to guide users directly to the contents. The secondary audience can freely browse all files in Studylog, allowing them to identify and provide proper and relevant information to their student or children. Despite the fact that the current website has achieved this goal satisfactorily, it still lacks improvements such as the implementation of the "syllabus update notification" said in the Statement of Intent, which would boost the quality of life for users overall.

The final aim attempted to achieve in Studylog was to have a simple, yet efficient UI design for busy students and users with limited knowledge on technology to navigate themselves easily. The product created can be commented that it has achieved this criteria strongly through the use of a persistent navbar, homepage, Bootstrap elements and keeping consistency of it throughout all the pages. The navbar appears on every page, allowing the user to have a stable anchor point that allows them to move between pages efficiently without confusion. As for the homepage, it contributes to the aim through utilising hero carousel, feature cards and a clean layout. These aspects of the homepage allows Studylog to provide users with an immediate overview of the website without being too complicated and overwhelming. Lastly, Bootstrap elements such as "col-md" are used throughout the whole site, structuring into a clean and readable look. It also automatically adjusts the layout on different sized screens, ensuring that the contents are remained organised. However, there were drawbacks with reliance of the grid system such as that the content collapses into vertical stacks on smaller screen, which may cause some pages to be crowded. This shows that although the current website strongly matches the aim of simplicity and efficiency, experiences on smaller devices requires further optimisation.


### 3.4 Overall Effectiveness (1–2 paragraphs)

> Step back from the detail. Overall, **how effective** is the website at
> achieving its purpose for its target audience? Weigh what works against what
> falls short, and state what you would improve to better meet your intent.

<!-- Write 1–2 paragraphs. -->
In conclusion, Studylog is reasonably effective, as it matches the aims of being relevant to study, targeted to our intended audience, and simple to navigate . It has made learning easier to access with the simple navigation, automatic year group loading feature, and a clean dashboard that separates core and elective resources. These features allow users to locate materials quickly without confusion. However, the site's effectiveness is limited as there are small numbers of changes that could be made, including to add more study resources, implementation of syllabus update and community area, and enhancing the layout of Studylog on all devices.

The single improvement that would most significantly upgrade Studylog is the implementing of the community comment area. This change has the potential to turn Studylog from a resource hub, into an active learning environment. Applying this would significantly enhance the collaborative learning between students, as it allows student to ask questions and provide feedback. In teacher's perspective, having the community area allows them to clarify topics for their students, and parents / guardians could engage in their child's learning more by understanding the topic and teaching it to their child. By intergrading this feature, Studylog would transform into a user-centred website, evolving into a platform that supports collaboration rather than just delivering static resources.
